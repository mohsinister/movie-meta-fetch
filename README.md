# Movie Metadata fetch
Fetch metadata of your movies easily with this script and save them in a html file to view/search for movies according to genre, awards, imdb rating. 


### How to use?
Sign Up on omdabpi.com and get apikey.
Put that key in main.py
Just run the python file, feed in the directory where all your movies are listed and kaboom! You will get a txt file with json data of all details related to the movie. Upload the *content.txt* and *index.html* in the same folder to view your movie metadata online. For the movie folders/files it coulnd't process it will add the details to the ERRORLOG file.

### How does it work?
This script will not work for everyone, I made it for my personal use and I have a habit of keeping my folders tidy. Generally all the movie files/folder in my hardrive are saved in this format *MOVIE NAME [YEAR]*, in some cases even *MOVIE NAME* would do.
Eg. of dummy folder
